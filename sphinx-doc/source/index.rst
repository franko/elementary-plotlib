Libcanvas Reference Manual
==========================

This is the reference documentation for the C and C++ interface of Libcanvas, a library for high-quality plots and animations.

In the chapter below you can find the documentation for the classes and functions that are part of the Libcanvas public C and C++ interfaces.
All the classes, functions and enumerators are defined inside the ``libcanvas`` namespace.

All the definitions are provided by a single header file, ``libcanvas.h``.

The recommended way to link with Libcanvas is to use the library flags provided by the pkg-config file.
