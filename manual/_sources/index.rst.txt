Elementary Plot library Reference Manual
========================================

This is the reference documentation for the C and C++ interface of `Elementary Plot <https://franko.github.io/elementary-plotlib/>`_, a library for high-quality plots and animations.

In the chapter below you can find the documentation for the classes and functions that are part of the Elementary Plot public C and C++ interfaces.
All the classes, functions and enumerators are defined inside the ``elp`` namespace.

All the definitions are provided by a single header file, ``libelplot.h``.
